/**
 * Handles launching the secure camera properly even when other applications may be using the camera
 * hardware.
 *
 * When other applications (e.g., Face Unlock) are using the camera, they must close the camera to
 * allow the secure camera to open it.  Since we want to minimize the delay when opening the secure
 * camera, other apps should close the camera at the first possible opportunity (i.e., as soon as
 * the user begins swiping to go to the secure camera).
 *
 * If the camera is unavailable when the user begins to swipe, the SecureCameraLaunchManager sends a
 * broadcast to tell other apps to close the camera.  When and if the user completes their swipe to
 * launch the secure camera, the SecureCameraLaunchManager delays launching the secure camera until
 * a callback indicates that the camera has become available.  If it doesn't receive that callback
 * within a specified timeout period, the secure camera is launched anyway.
 *
 * Ideally, the secure camera would handle waiting for the camera to become available.  This allows
 * some of the time necessary to close the camera to happen in parallel with starting the secure
 * camera app.  We can't rely on all third-party camera apps to handle this.  However, an app can
 * put com.android.systemui.statusbar.phone.will_wait_for_camera_available in its meta-data to
 * indicate that it will be responsible for waiting for the camera to become available.
 *
 * It is assumed that the functions in this class, including the constructor, will be called from
 * the UI thread.
