      * This class filters the raw accelerometer data and tries to detect actual changes in
      * orientation. This is a very ill-defined problem so there are a lot of tweakable parameters,
      * but here's the outline:
      *
      *  - Low-pass filter the accelerometer vector in cartesian coordinates.  We do it in
      *    cartesian space because the orientation calculations are sensitive to the
      *    absolute magnitude of the acceleration.  In particular, there are singularities
      *    in the calculation as the magnitude approaches 0.  By performing the low-pass
      *    filtering early, we can eliminate most spurious high-frequency impulses due to noise.
      *
      *  - Convert the acceleromter vector from cartesian to spherical coordinates.
      *    Since we're dealing with rotation of the device, this is the sensible coordinate
      *    system to work in.  The zenith direction is the Z-axis, the direction the screen
      *    is facing.  The radial distance is referred to as the magnitude below.
      *    The elevation angle is referred to as the "tilt" below.
      *    The azimuth angle is referred to as the "orientation" below (and the azimuth axis is
      *    the Y-axis).
      *    See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spherical_coordinate_system for reference.
      *
      *  - If the tilt angle is too close to horizontal (near 90 or -90 degrees), do nothing.
      *    The orientation angle is not meaningful when the device is nearly horizontal.
      *    The tilt angle thresholds are set differently for each orientation and different
      *    limits are applied when the device is facing down as opposed to when it is facing
      *    forward or facing up.
      *
      *  - When the orientation angle reaches a certain threshold, consider transitioning
      *    to the corresponding orientation.  These thresholds have some hysteresis built-in
      *    to avoid oscillations between adjacent orientations.
      *
      *  - Wait for the device to settle for a little bit.  Once that happens, issue the
      *    new orientation proposal.
      *
      * Details are explained inline.
      *
      * See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low-pass_filter#Discrete-time_realization for
      * signal processing background.
