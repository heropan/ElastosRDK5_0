/**
 * A class that performs asynchronous loading of data. While Loaders are active
 * they should monitor the source of their data and deliver new results when the contents
 * change.  See {@link android.app.LoaderManager} for more detail.
 *
 * <p><b>Note on threading:</b> Clients of loaders should as a rule perform
 * any calls on to a Loader from the main thread of their process (that is,
 * the thread the Activity callbacks and other things occur on).  Subclasses
 * of Loader (such as {@link AsyncTaskLoader}) will often perform their work
 * in a separate thread, but when delivering their results this too should
 * be done on the main thread.</p>
 *
 * <p>Subclasses generally must implement at least {@link #onStartLoading()},
 * {@link #onStopLoading()}, {@link #onForceLoad()}, and {@link #onReset()}.</p>
 *
 * <p>Most implementations should not derive directly from this class, but
 * instead inherit from {@link AsyncTaskLoader}.</p>
 *
