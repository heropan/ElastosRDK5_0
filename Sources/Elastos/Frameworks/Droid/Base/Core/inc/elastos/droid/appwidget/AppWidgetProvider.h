 * {@link #onReceive(Context,Intent) onReceive(Context,Intent)}, and calls hook methods
 * with the received extras.
 *
 * <p>Extend this class and override one or more of the {@link #onUpdate}, {@link #onDeleted},
 * {@link #onEnabled} or {@link #onDisabled} methods to implement your own AppWidget functionality.
