/**
 * Manages oom bindings used to bound child services. "Oom binding" is a binding that raises the
 * process oom priority so that it shouldn't be killed by the OS out-of-memory killer under
 * normal conditions (it can still be killed under drastic memory pressure). ChildProcessConnections
 * have two oom bindings: initial binding and strong binding.
 *
 * BindingManager receives calls that signal visibility of each service (setInForeground()) and the
 * entire embedding application (onSentToBackground(), onBroughtToForeground()) and manipulates
 * child process bindings accordingly.
 *
 * In particular, BindingManager is responsible for:
 * - removing the initial binding of a service when its visibility is determined for the first time
 * - addition and (possibly delayed) removal of a strong binding when service visibility changes
 * - dropping the current oom bindings when a new connection is started on a low-memory device
 * - keeping a strong binding on the foreground service while the entire application is in
 *   background
 *
 * Thread-safety: most of the methods will be called only on the main thread, exceptions are
 * explicitly noted.
