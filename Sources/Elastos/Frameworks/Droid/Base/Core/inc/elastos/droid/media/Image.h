/**
 * <p>A single complete image buffer to use with a media source such as a
 * {@link MediaCodec} or a
 * {@link android.hardware.camera2.CameraDevice CameraDevice}.</p>
 *
 * <p>This class allows for efficient direct application access to the pixel
 * data of the Image through one or more
 * {@link java.nio.ByteBuffer ByteBuffers}. Each buffer is encapsulated in a
 * {@link Plane} that describes the layout of the pixel data in that plane. Due
 * to this direct access, and unlike the {@link android.graphics.Bitmap Bitmap} class,
 * Images are not directly usable as as UI resources.</p>
 *
 * <p>Since Images are often directly produced or consumed by hardware
 * components, they are a limited resource shared across the system, and should
 * be closed as soon as they are no longer needed.</p>
 *
 * <p>For example, when using the {@link ImageReader} class to read out Images
 * from various media sources, not closing old Image objects will prevent the
 * availability of new Images once
 * {@link ImageReader#getMaxImages the maximum outstanding image count} is
 * reached. When this happens, the function acquiring new Images will typically
 * throw an {@link IllegalStateException}.</p>
