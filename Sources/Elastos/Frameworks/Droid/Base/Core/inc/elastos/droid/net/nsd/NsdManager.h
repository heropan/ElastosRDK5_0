/**
 * The Network Service Discovery Manager class provides the API to discover services
 * on a network. As an example, if device A and device B are connected over a Wi-Fi
 * network, a game registered on device A can be discovered by a game on device
 * B. Another example use case is an application discovering printers on the network.
 *
 * <p> The API currently supports DNS based service discovery and discovery is currently
 * limited to a local network over Multicast DNS. DNS service discovery is described at
 * http://files.dns-sd.org/draft-cheshire-dnsext-dns-sd.txt
 *
 * <p> The API is asynchronous and responses to requests from an application are on listener
 * callbacks on a seperate thread.
 *
 * <p> There are three main operations the API supports - registration, discovery and resolution.

 *                     Establish connection to service
 *                     with the host and port information
 *
 * </pre>
 * An application that needs to advertise itself over a network for other applications to
 * discover it can do so with a call to {@link #registerService}. If Example is a http based
 * application that can provide HTML data to peer services, it can register a name "Example"
 * with service type "_http._tcp". A successful registration is notified with a callback to
 * {@link RegistrationListener#onServiceRegistered} and a failure to register is notified
 * over {@link RegistrationListener#onRegistrationFailed}
 *
 * <p> A peer application looking for http services can initiate a discovery for "_http._tcp"
 * with a call to {@link #discoverServices}. A service found is notified with a callback
 * to {@link DiscoveryListener#onServiceFound} and a service lost is notified on
 * {@link DiscoveryListener#onServiceLost}.
 *
 * <p> Once the peer application discovers the "Example" http srevice, and needs to receive data
 * from the "Example" application, it can initiate a resolve with {@link #resolveService} to
 * resolve the host and port details for the purpose of establishing a connection. A successful
 * resolve is notified on {@link ResolveListener#onServiceResolved} and a failure is notified
 * on {@link ResolveListener#onResolveFailed}.
 *
 * Applications can reserve for a service type at
 * http://www.iana.org/form/ports-service. Existing services can be found at
 * http://www.iana.org/assignments/service-names-port-numbers/service-names-port-numbers.xml
 *
 * Get an instance of this class by calling {@link android.content.Context#getSystemService(String)
