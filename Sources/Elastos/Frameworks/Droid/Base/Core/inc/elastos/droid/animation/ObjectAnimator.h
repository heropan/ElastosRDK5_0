     * in a call to the function <code>setFoo()</code> on the target object. If either
     * <code>valueFrom</code> or <code>valueTo</code> is NULL, then a getter function will
     * also be derived and called.
     *
     * <p>For best performance of the mechanism that calls the setter function determined by the
     * name of the property being animated, use <code>Float</code> or <code>Int32</code> typed values,
     * and make the setter function for those properties have a <code>void</code> return value. This
     * will cause the code to take an optimized path for these constrained circumstances. Other
     * property types and return types will work, but will have more overhead in processing
     * the requests due to normal reflection mechanisms.</p>
     *
     * <p>Note that the setter function derived from this property name
     * must take the same parameter type as the
     * <code>valueFrom</code> and <code>valueTo</code> properties, otherwise the call to
     * the setter function will fail.</p>
     *

     * sets the propertyName in the first of those PropertyValuesHolder objects.</p>
