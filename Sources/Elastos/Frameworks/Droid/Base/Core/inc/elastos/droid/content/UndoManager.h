/**
 * Top-level class for managing and interacting with the global undo state for
 * a document or application.  This class supports both undo and redo and has
 * helpers for merging undoable operations together as they are performed.
 *
 * <p>A single undoable operation is represented by {@link UndoOperation} which
 * apps implement to define their undo/redo behavior.  The UndoManager keeps
 * a stack of undo states; each state can have one or more undo operations
 * inside of it.</p>
 *
 * <p>Updates to the stack must be done inside of a {@link #beginUpdate}/{@link #endUpdate()}
 * pair.  During this time you can add new operations to the stack with
 * {@link #addOperation}, retrieve and modify existing operations with
 * {@link #getLastOperation}, control the label shown to the user for this operation
 * with {@link #setUndoLabel} and {@link #suggestUndoLabel}, etc.</p>
 *
 * <p>Every {link UndoOperation} is associated with an {@link UndoOwner}, which identifies
 * the data it belongs to.  The owner is used to indicate how operations are dependent
 * on each other -- operations with the same owner are dependent on others with the
 * same owner.  For example, you may have a document with multiple embedded objects.  If the
 * document itself and each embedded object use different owners, then you
 * can provide undo semantics appropriate to the user's context: while within
 * an embedded object, only edits to that object are seen and the user can
 * undo/redo them without needing to impact edits in other objects; while
 * within the larger document, all edits can be seen and the user must
 * undo/redo them as a single stream.</p>
