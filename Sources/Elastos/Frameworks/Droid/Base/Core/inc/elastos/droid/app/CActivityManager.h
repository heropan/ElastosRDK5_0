     * @hide
     * Helper for dealing with incoming user arguments to system service calls.
     * Takes care of checking permissions and converting USER_CURRENT to the
     * actual current user.
     *
     * @param callingPid The pid of the incoming call, as per Binder.getCallingPid().
     * @param callingUid The uid of the incoming call, as per Binder.getCallingUid().
     * @param userId The user id argument supplied by the caller -- this is the user
     * they want to run as.
     * @param allowAll If true, we will allow USER_ALL.  This means you must be prepared
     * to get a USER_ALL returned and deal with it correctly.  If false,
     * an exception will be thrown if USER_ALL is supplied.
     * @param requireFull If true, the caller must hold
     * {@link android.Manifest.permission#INTERACT_ACROSS_USERS_FULL} to be able to run as a
     * different user than their current process; otherwise they must hold
     * {@link android.Manifest.permission#INTERACT_ACROSS_USERS}.
     * @param name Optional textual name of the incoming call; only for generating error messages.
     * @param callerPackage Optional package name of caller; only for error messages.
     *
     * @return Returns the user ID that the call should run as.  Will always be a concrete
     * user number, unless <var>allowAll</var> is true in which case it could also be
     * USER_ALL.
