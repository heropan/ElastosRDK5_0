     * cannot use this bitmap, the decode method will return
     * <code>null</code> and will throw an IllegalArgumentException. The
     * current implementation necessitates that the reused bitmap be
     * mutable, and the resulting reused bitmap will continue to remain
     * mutable even when decoding a resource which would normally result in
     * an immutable bitmap.</p>
     *
     * <p>You should still always use the returned Bitmap of the decode
     * method and not assume that reusing the bitmap worked, due to the
     * constraints outlined above and failure situations that can occur.
     * Checking whether the return value matches the value of the inBitmap
     * set in the Options structure will indicate if the bitmap was reused,
     * but in all cases you should use the Bitmap returned by the decoding
     * function to ensure that you are using the bitmap that was used as the
     * decode destination.</p>
     *
     * <h3>Usage with BitmapFactory</h3>
     *
     * <p>As of {@link android.os.Build.VERSION_CODES#KITKAT}, any
     * mutable bitmap can be reused by {@link BitmapFactory} to decode any
     * other bitmaps as long as the resulting {@link Bitmap#getByteCount()
     * byte count} of the decoded bitmap is less than or equal to the {@link
     * Bitmap#getAllocationByteCount() allocated byte count} of the reused
     * bitmap. This can be because the intrinsic size is smaller, or its
     * size post scaling (for density / sample size) is smaller.</p>
     *
     * <p class="note">Prior to {@link android.os.Build.VERSION_CODES#KITKAT}
     * additional constraints apply: The image being decoded (whether as a
     * resource or as a stream) must be in jpeg or png format. Only equal
     * sized bitmaps are supported, with {@link #inSampleSize} set to 1.
     * Additionally, the {@link android.graphics.Bitmap.Config
     * configuration} of the reused bitmap will override the setting of
     * {@link #inPreferredConfig}, if set.</p>
     *
     * <h3>Usage with BitmapRegionDecoder</h3>
     *
     * <p>BitmapRegionDecoder will draw its requested content into the Bitmap
     * provided, clipping if the output content size (post scaling) is larger
     * than the provided Bitmap. The provided Bitmap's width, height, and
     * {@link Bitmap.Config} will not be changed.
     *
     * <p class="note">BitmapRegionDecoder support for {@link #inBitmap} was
     * introduced in {@link android.os.Build.VERSION_CODES#JELLY_BEAN}. All
