 * Any application using a WakeLock must request the {@code android.permission.WAKE_LOCK}
 * permission in an {@code &lt;uses-permission&gt;} element of the application's manifest.
 * Obtain a wake lock by calling {@link PowerManager#newWakeLock(int, String)}.
 * </p><p>
 * Call {@link #acquire()} to acquire the wake lock and force the device to stay
 * on at the level that was requested when the wake lock was created.
 * </p><p>
 * Call {@link #release()} when you are done and don't need the lock anymore.
 * It is very important to do this as soon as possible to avoid running down the
 * device's battery excessively.
