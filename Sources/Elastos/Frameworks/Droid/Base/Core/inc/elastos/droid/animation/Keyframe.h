/**
 * This class holds a time/value pair for an animation. The Keyframe class is used
 * by {@link ValueAnimator} to define the values that the animation target will have over the course
 * of the animation. As the time proceeds from one keyframe to the other, the value of the
 * target object will animate between the value at the previous keyframe and the value at the
 * next keyframe. Each keyframe also holds an optional {@link TimeInterpolator}
 * object, which defines the time interpolation over the intervalue preceding the keyframe.
 *
 * <p>The Keyframe class itself is abstract. The type-specific factory methods will return
 * a subclass of Keyframe specific to the type of value being stored. This is done to improve
 * performance when dealing with the most common cases (e.g., <code>float</code> and
 * <code>int</code> values). Other types will fall into a more general Keyframe class that
 * treats its values as Objects. Unless your animation requires dealing with a custom type
 * or a data structure that needs to be animated directly (and evaluated using an implementation
 * of {@link TypeEvaluator}), you should stick to using float and int as animations using those
 * types have lower runtime overhead than other types.</p>
