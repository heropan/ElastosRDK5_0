     * employed from the view logic.

     * scrolled through is all on the same tab.  The selected tab only
     * changes when we navigate between tabs (moving from the list view
     * to the next tabbed view, in this example).
     *
     * To move both the focus AND the selected tab at once, please use
     * {@link #setCurrentTab}. Normally, the view logic takes care of
     * adjusting the focus, so unless you're circumventing the UI,
     * you'll probably just focus your interest here.
