/**
 * Coordinates the timing of animations, input and drawing.
 * <p>
 * The choreographer receives timing pulses (such as vertical synchronization)
 * from the display subsystem then schedules work to occur as part of rendering
 * the next display frame.
 * </p><p>
 * Applications typically interact with the choreographer indirectly using
 * higher level abstractions in the animation framework or the view hierarchy.
 * Here are some examples of things you can do using the higher-level APIs.
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>To post an animation to be processed on a regular time basis synchronized with
 * display frame rendering, use {@link android.animation.ValueAnimator#start}.</li>
 * <li>To post a {@link Runnable} to be invoked once at the beginning of the next display
 * frame, use {@link View#postOnAnimation}.</li>
 * <li>To post a {@link Runnable} to be invoked once at the beginning of the next display
 * frame after a delay, use {@link View#postOnAnimationDelayed}.</li>
 * <li>To post a call to {@link View#invalidate()} to occur once at the beginning of the
 * next display frame, use {@link View#postInvalidateOnAnimation()} or
 * {@link View#postInvalidateOnAnimation(Int32, Int32, Int32, Int32)}.</li>
 * <li>To ensure that the contents of a {@link View} scroll smoothly and are drawn in
 * sync with display frame rendering, do nothing.  This already happens automatically.
 * {@link View#onDraw} will be called at the appropriate time.</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * However, there are a few cases where you might want to use the functions of the
 * choreographer directly in your application.  Here are some examples.
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>If your application does its rendering in a different thread, possibly using GL,
 * or does not use the animation framework or view hierarchy at all
 * and you want to ensure that it is appropriately synchronized with the display, then use
 * {@link Choreographer#postFrameCallback}.</li>
 * <li>... and that's about it.</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * Each {@link Looper} thread has its own choreographer.  Other threads can
 * post callbacks to run on the choreographer but they will run on the {@link Looper}
 * to which the choreographer belongs.
 * </p>
