/**
 * This class is used to manage the JavaScript storage APIs provided by the
 * {@link WebView}. It manages the Application Cache API, the Web SQL Database
 * API and the HTML5 Web Storage API.
 *
 * The Application Cache API provides a mechanism to create and maintain an
 * application cache to power offline Web applications. Use of the Application
 * Cache API can be attributed to an origin {@link WebStorage.Origin}, however
 * it is not possible to set per-origin quotas. Note that there can be only
 * one application cache per application.
 *
 * The Web SQL Database API provides storage which is private to a given origin.
 * Similar to the Application Cache, use of the Web SQL Database can be attributed
 * to an origin. It is also possible to set per-origin quotas.
