     * This method enables parallel execution of queries from multiple threads on the
     * same database.  It does this by opening multiple connections to the database
     * and using a different database connection for each query.  The database
     * journal mode is also changed to enable writes to proceed concurrently with reads.
     * <p>
     * When write-ahead logging is not enabled (the default), it is not possible for
     * reads and writes to occur on the database at the same time.  Before modifying the
     * database, the writer implicitly acquires an exclusive lock on the database which
     * prevents readers from accessing the database until the write is completed.
     * </p><p>
     * In contrast, when write-ahead logging is enabled (by calling this method), write
     * operations occur in a separate log file which allows reads to proceed concurrently.
     * While a write is in progress, readers on other threads will perceive the state
     * of the database as it was before the write began.  When the write completes, readers
     * on other threads will then perceive the new state of the database.
     * </p><p>
     * It is a good idea to enable write-ahead logging whenever a database will be
     * concurrently accessed and modified by multiple threads at the same time.
     * However, write-ahead logging uses significantly more memory than ordinary
     * journaling because there are multiple connections to the same database.
     * So if a database will only be used by a single thread, or if optimizing
     * concurrency is not very important, then write-ahead logging should be disabled.
     * </p><p>
     * After calling this method, execution of queries in parallel is enabled as long as
     * the database remains open.  To disable execution of queries in parallel, either
     * call {@link #disableWriteAheadLogging} or close the database and reopen it.
     * </p><p>
     * The maximum number of connections used to execute queries in parallel is
     * dependent upon the device memory and possibly other properties.
     * </p><p>
     * If a query is part of a transaction, then it is executed on the same database handle the
     * transaction was begun.
     * </p><p>
     * Writers should use {@link #beginTransactionNonExclusive()} or
     * {@link #beginTransactionWithListenerNonExclusive(SQLiteTransactionListener)}
     * to start a transaction.  Non-exclusive mode allows database file to be in readable
     * by other threads executing queries.
     * </p><p>
     * If the database has any attached databases, then execution of queries in parallel is NOT
     * possible.  Likewise, write-ahead logging is not supported for read-only databases
     * or memory databases.  In such cases, {@link #enableWriteAheadLogging} returns false.
     * </p><p>
     * The best way to enable write-ahead logging is to pass the
