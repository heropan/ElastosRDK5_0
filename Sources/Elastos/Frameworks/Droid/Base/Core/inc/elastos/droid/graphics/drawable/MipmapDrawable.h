/**
 * @hide -- we are probably moving to do MipMaps in another way (more integrated
 * with the resource system).
 *
 * A resource that manages a number of alternate Drawables, and which actually draws the one which
 * size matches the most closely the drawing bounds. Providing several pre-scaled version of the
 * drawable helps minimizing the aliasing artifacts that can be introduced by the scaling.
 *
 * <p>
 * Use {@link #addDrawable(Drawable)} to define the different Drawables that will represent the
 * mipmap levels of this MipmapDrawable. The mipmap Drawable that will actually be used when this
 * MipmapDrawable is drawn is the one which has the smallest intrinsic height greater or equal than
 * the bounds' height. This selection ensures that the best available mipmap level is scaled down to
 * draw this MipmapDrawable.
 * </p>
 *
 * If the bounds' height is larger than the largest mipmap, the largest mipmap will be scaled up.
 * Note that Drawables without intrinsic height (i.e. with a negative value, such as Color) will
 * only be used if no other mipmap Drawable are provided. The Drawables' intrinsic heights should
 * not be changed after the Drawable has been added to this MipmapDrawable.
 *
 * <p>
 * The different mipmaps' parameters (opacity, padding, color filter, gravity...) should typically
 * be similar to ensure a continuous visual appearance when the MipmapDrawable is scaled. The aspect
 * ratio of the different mipmaps should especially be equal.
 * </p>
 *
 * A typical example use of a MipmapDrawable would be for an image which is intended to be scaled at
 * various sizes, and for which one wants to provide pre-scaled versions to precisely control its
 * appearance.
 *
 * <p>
 * The intrinsic size of a MipmapDrawable are inferred from those of the largest mipmap (in terms of
 * {@link Drawable#getIntrinsicHeight()}). On the opposite, its minimum
 * size is defined by the smallest provided mipmap.
 * </p>

 * It can be defined in an XML file with the <code>&lt;mipmap></code> element.
 * Each mipmap Drawable is defined in a nested <code>&lt;item></code>. For example:
 * <pre>
 * &lt;mipmap xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android">
 *  &lt;item android:drawable="@drawable/my_image_8" />
 *  &lt;item android:drawable="@drawable/my_image_32" />
 *  &lt;item android:drawable="@drawable/my_image_128" />
 * &lt;/mipmap>
 *</pre>
 * <p>
 * With this XML saved into the res/drawable/ folder of the project, it can be referenced as
 * the drawable for an {@link android.widget.ImageView}. Assuming that the heights of the provided
 * drawables are respectively 8, 32 and 128 pixels, the first one will be scaled down when the
 * bounds' height is lower or equal than 8 pixels. The second drawable will then be used up to a
 * height of 32 pixels and the largest drawable will be used for greater heights.
 * </p>
