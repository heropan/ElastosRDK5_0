     * The AudioGain describes a gain controller. Gain controllers are exposed by
     * audio ports when the gain is configurable at this port's input or output.
     * Gain values are expressed in millibels.
     * A gain controller has the following attributes:
     * - mode: defines modes of operation or features
     *    MODE_JOINT: all channel gains are controlled simultaneously
     *    MODE_CHANNELS: each channel gain is controlled individually
     *    MODE_RAMP: ramps can be applied when gain changes
     * - channel mask: indicates for which channels the gain can be controlled
     * - min value: minimum gain value in millibel
     * - max value: maximum gain value in millibel
     * - default value: gain value after reset in millibel
     * - step value: granularity of gain control in millibel
     * - min ramp duration: minimum ramp duration in milliseconds
     * - max ramp duration: maximum ramp duration in milliseconds
     *
     * This object is always created by the framework and read only by applications.
     * Applications get a list of AudioGainDescriptors from AudioPortDescriptor.gains() and can build a
     * valid gain configuration from AudioGain.buildConfig()
