    /**
     * VpnService is a base class for applications to extend and build their
     * own VPN solutions. In general, it creates a virtual network interface,
     * configures addresses and routing rules, and returns a file descriptor
     * to the application. Each read from the descriptor retrieves an outgoing
     * packet which was routed to the interface. Each write to the descriptor
     * injects an incoming packet just like it was received from the interface.
     * The interface is running on Internet Protocol (IP), so packets are
     * always started with IP headers. The application then completes a VPN
     * connection by processing and exchanging packets with the remote server
     * over a tunnel.
     *
     * <p>Letting applications intercept packets raises huge security concerns.
     * A VPN application can easily break the network. Besides, two of them may
     * conflict with each other. The system takes several actions to address
     * these issues. Here are some key points:
     * <ul>
     *   <li>User action is required the first time an application creates a VPN
     *       connection.</li>
     *   <li>There can be only one VPN connection running at the same time. The
     *       existing interface is deactivated when a new one is created.</li>
     *   <li>A system-managed notification is shown during the lifetime of a
     *       VPN connection.</li>
     *   <li>A system-managed dialog gives the information of the current VPN
     *       connection. It also provides a button to disconnect.</li>
     *   <li>The network is restored automatically when the file descriptor is
     *       closed. It also covers the cases when a VPN application is crashed
     *       or killed by the system.</li>
     * </ul>
     *
     * <p>There are two primary methods in this class: {@link #prepare} and
     * {@link Builder#establish}. The former deals with user action and stops
     * the VPN connection created by another application. The latter creates
     * a VPN interface using the parameters supplied to the {@link Builder}.
     * An application must call {@link #prepare} to grant the right to use
     * other methods in this class, and the right can be revoked at any time.
     * Here are the general steps to create a VPN connection:
     * <ol>
     *   <li>When the user presses the button to connect, call {@link #prepare}
     *       and launch the returned intent, if non-null.</li>
     *   <li>When the application becomes prepared, start the service.</li>
     *   <li>Create a tunnel to the remote server and negotiate the network
     *       parameters for the VPN connection.</li>
     *   <li>Supply those parameters to a {@link Builder} and create a VPN
     *       interface by calling {@link Builder#establish}.</li>
     *   <li>Process and exchange packets between the tunnel and the returned
     *       file descriptor.</li>
     *   <li>When {@link #onRevoke} is invoked, close the file descriptor and
     *       shut down the tunnel gracefully.</li>
     * </ol>
     *
     * <p>Services extended this class need to be declared with appropriate
     * permission and intent filter. Their access must be secured by
     * {@link android.Manifest.permission#BIND_VPN_SERVICE} permission, and
     * their intent filter must match {@link #SERVICE_INTERFACE} action. Here
     * is an example of declaring a VPN service in {@code AndroidManifest.xml}:
     * <pre>
     * &lt;service android:name=".ExampleVpnService"
     *         android:permission="android.permission.BIND_VPN_SERVICE"&gt;
     *     &lt;intent-filter&gt;
     *         &lt;action android:name="android.net.VpnService"/&gt;

         * from the interface. The file descriptor is put into non-blocking
         * mode by default to avoid blocking Java threads. To use the file
         * descriptor completely in native space, see
         * {@link ParcelFileDescriptor#detachFd()}. The application MUST
         * close the file descriptor when the VPN connection is terminated.
         * The VPN interface will be removed and the network will be
         * restored by the system automatically.
         *
         * <p>To avoid conflicts, there can be only one active VPN interface
         * at the same time. Usually network parameters are never changed
         * during the lifetime of a VPN connection. It is also common for an
         * application to create a new file descriptor after closing the
         * previous one. However, it is rare but not impossible to have two
         * interfaces while performing a seamless handover. In this case, the
         * old interface will be deactivated when the new one is created
         * successfully. Both file descriptors are valid but now outgoing
         * packets will be routed to the new interface. Therefore, after
         * draining the old file descriptor, the application MUST close it
         * and start using the new file descriptor. If the new interface
         * cannot be created, the existing interface and its file descriptor
         * remain untouched.
         *
         * <p>An exception will be thrown if the interface cannot be created
         * for any reason. However, this method returns {@code null} if the
         * application is not prepared or is revoked. This helps solve
         * possible race conditions between other VPN applications.
