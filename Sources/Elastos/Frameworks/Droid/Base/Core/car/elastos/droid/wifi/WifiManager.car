     * connectivity. Get an instance of this class by calling
     * {@link android.content.Context#getSystemService(String) Context.getSystemService(Context.WIFI_SERVICE)}.
     * It deals with several categories of items:
     * <ul>
     * <li>The list of configured networks. The list can be viewed and updated,
     * and attributes of individual entries can be modified.</li>
     * <li>The currently active Wi-Fi network, if any. Connectivity can be
     * established or torn down, and dynamic information about the state of
     * the network can be queried.</li>
     * <li>Results of access point scans, containing enough information to
     * make decisions about what access point to connect to.</li>
     * <li>It defines the names of various Intent actions that are broadcast
     * upon any sort of change in Wi-Fi state.
     * </ul>
     * This is the API to use when performing Wi-Fi specific operations. To
     * perform operations that pertain to network connectivity at an abstract
     * level, use {@link android.net.ConnectivityManager}.
