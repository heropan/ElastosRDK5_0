    /**
     * Class that describes static IP configuration.
     *
     * This class is different from LinkProperties because it represents
     * configuration intent. The general contract is that if we can represent
     * a configuration here, then we should be able to configure it on a network.
     * The intent is that it closely match the UI we have for configuring networks.
     *
     * In contrast, LinkProperties represents current state. It is much more
     * expressive. For example, it supports multiple IP addresses, multiple routes,
     * stacked interfaces, and so on. Because LinkProperties is so expressive,
     * using it to represent configuration intent as well as current state causes
     * problems. For example, we could unknowingly save a configuration that we are
     * not in fact capable of applying, or we could save a configuration that the
     * UI cannot display, which has the potential for malicious code to hide
     * hostile or unexpected configuration from the user: see, for example,
     * http://b/12663469 and http://b/16893413 .
