 * </p><ul>
 * <li>The constructor is called and provided with the system {@link Context}
 * to initialize the system service.
 * <li>{@link #onStart()} is called to get the service running.  The service should
 * publish its binder interface at this point using
 * {@link #PublishBinderService(String, IBinder)}.  It may also publish additional
 * local interfaces that other services within the system server may use to access
 * privileged internal functions.
 * <li>Then {@link #onBootPhase(int)} is called as many times as there are boot phases
 * until {@link #PHASE_BOOT_COMPLETE} is sent, which is the last boot phase. Each phase
 * is an opportunity to do special work, like acquiring optional service dependencies,
 * waiting to see if SafeMode is enabled, or registering with a service that gets
 * started after this one.
 * </ul><p>
 * NOTE: All lifecycle methods are called from the system server's main looper thread.
