/**
 * Implements heuristics to detect docking or undocking from a wireless charger.
 * <p>
 * Some devices have wireless charging circuits that are unable to detect when the
 * device is resting on a wireless charger except when the device is actually
 * receiving power from the charger.  The device may stop receiving power
 * if the battery is already nearly full or if it is too hot.  As a result, we cannot
 * always rely on the battery service wireless plug signal to accurately indicate
 * whether the device has been docked or undocked from a wireless charger.
 * </p><p>
 * This is a problem because the power manager typically wakes up the screen and
 * plays a tone when the device is docked in a wireless charger.  It is important
 * for the system to suppress spurious docking and undocking signals because they
 * can be intrusive for the user (especially if they cause a tone to be played
 * late at night for no apparent reason).
 * </p><p>
 * To avoid spurious signals, we apply some special policies to wireless chargers.
 * </p><p>
 * 1. Don't wake the device when undocked from the wireless charger because
 * it might be that the device is still resting on the wireless charger
 * but is not receiving power anymore because the battery is full.
 * Ideally we would wake the device if we could be certain that the user had
 * picked it up from the wireless charger but due to hardware limitations we
 * must be more conservative.
 * </p><p>
 * 2. Don't wake the device when docked on a wireless charger if the
 * battery already appears to be mostly full.  This situation may indicate
 * that the device was resting on the charger the whole time and simply
 * wasn't receiving power because the battery was already full.  We can't tell
 * whether the device was just placed on the charger or whether it has
 * been there for half of the night slowly discharging until it reached
 * the point where it needed to start charging again.  So we suppress docking
 * signals that occur when the battery level is above a given threshold.
 * </p><p>
 * 3. Don't wake the device when docked on a wireless charger if it does
 * not appear to have moved since it was last undocked because it may
 * be that the prior undocking signal was spurious.  We use the gravity
 * sensor to detect this case.
 * </p>
