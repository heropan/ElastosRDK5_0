/**
 * Describes how a logical display is configured.
 * <p>
 * At this time, we only support logical displays that are coupled to a particular
 * primary display device from which the logical display derives its basic properties
 * such as its size, density and refresh rate.
 * </p><p>
 * A logical display may be mirrored onto multiple display devices in addition to its
 * primary display device.  Note that the contents of a logical display may not
 * always be visible, even on its primary display device, such as in the case where
 * the primary display device is currently mirroring content from a different
 * logical display.
 * </p><p>
 * This object is designed to encapsulate as much of the policy of logical
 * displays as possible.  The idea is to make it easy to implement new kinds of
 * logical displays mostly by making local changes to this class.
 * </p><p>
 * Note: The display manager architecture does not actually require logical displays
 * to be associated with any individual display device.  Logical displays and
 * display devices are orthogonal concepts.  Some mapping will exist between
 * logical displays and display devices but it can be many-to-many and
 * and some might have no relation at all.
 * </p><p>
 * Logical displays are guarded by the {@link DisplayManagerService.SyncRoot} lock.
 * </p>
