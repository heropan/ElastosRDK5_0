/**
 * An instance of the class {@code Preferences} represents one node in a
 * preference tree, which provides a mechanism to store and access configuration
 * data in a hierarchical way. Two hierarchy trees are maintained, one for
 * system preferences shared by all users and the other for user preferences
 * specific to the user. {@code Preferences} hierarchy trees and data are stored
 * in an implementation-dependent back-end.
 * <p>
 * Every node has one name and one unique absolute path following the same
 * notational conventions as directories in a file system. The root node's
 * name is "", and other node name strings cannot contain the slash character
 * and cannot be empty. The root node's absolute path is "/", and all other
 * nodes' absolute paths are constructed in the standard way: &lt;parent's
 * absolute path&gt; + "/" + &lt;node's name&gt;. Since the set of nodes forms a
 * tree with the root node at its base, all absolute paths start with the slash
 * character. Every node has one relative path to each of its ancestors. The
 * relative path doesn't start with slash: it equals the node's absolute path
 * with leading substring removed corresponding to the ancestor's absolute path
 * and a slash.
 * <p>
 * Modification to preferences data may be asynchronous, which means that
 * preference update method calls may return immediately instead of blocking.
 * The {@code flush()} and {@code sync()} methods force the back-end to
 * synchronously perform all pending updates, but the implementation is
 * permitted to perform the modifications on the underlying back-end data
 * at any time between the moment the request is made and the moment the
 * {@code flush()} or {@code sync()} method returns. Please note that if the JVM
 * exits normally, the implementation must assure all modifications are
 * persisted implicitly.
 * <p>
 * When invoking a method that retrieves preferences, the user must provide
 * a default value. The default value is returned when the preferences cannot
 * be found or the back-end is unavailable. Some other methods will throw
 * {@code BackingStoreException} when the back-end is unavailable.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Preferences can be exported to and imported from an XML files. These
 * documents must have an XML DOCTYPE declaration:
 * <pre>{@code
 * <!DOCTYPE preferences SYSTEM "http://java.sun.com/dtd/preferences.dtd">
 * }</pre>
 * This system URI is not really accessed by network, it is only a
 * identification string. Visit the DTD location to see the actual format
 * permitted.
 * <p>
 * There must be a concrete {@code PreferencesFactory} type for every concrete
 * {@code Preferences} type developed. Every J2SE implementation must provide a
 * default implementation for every supported platform, and must also provide a
 * means of replacing the default implementation. This implementation uses the
 * system property {@code java.util.prefs.PreferencesFactory} to determine which
 * preferences implementation to use.
 * <p>
 * The methods of this class are thread-safe. If multiple JVMs are using the
 * same back-end concurrently, the back-end won't be corrupted, but no other
 * behavior guarantees are made.
