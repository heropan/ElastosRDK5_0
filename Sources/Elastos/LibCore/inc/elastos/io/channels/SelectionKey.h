 * A {@code SelectionKey} represents the relationship between a channel and a
 * selector for which the channel is registered.
 * <h3>Operation set</h3>
 * An operation set is represented by an integer value. The bits of an operation
 * set represent categories of operations for a key's channel: Accepting socket
 * connections ({@code OP_ACCEPT}), connecting with a socket ({@code OP_CONNECT}),
 * reading ({@code OP_READ}) and writing ({@code OP_WRITE}).
 * <h4>Interest set</h4>
 * The interest set is an operation set that defines the operations that a
 * {@link SelectableChannel channel} is interested in performing.
 * <h4>Ready set</h4>
 * The ready set is an operation set that shows the operations that a
 * {@code channel} is ready to execute.
