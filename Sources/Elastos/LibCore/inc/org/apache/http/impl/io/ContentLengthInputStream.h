/**
 * Stream that cuts off after a specified number of bytes.
 * Note that this class NEVER closes the underlying stream, even when close
 * gets called.  Instead, it will read until the "end" of its chunking on
 * close, which allows for the seamless execution of subsequent HTTP 1.1
 * requests, while not requiring the client to remember to read the entire
 * contents of the response.
 *
 * <p>Implementation note: Choices abound. One approach would pass
 * through the {@link InputStream#mark} and {@link InputStream#reset} calls to
 * the underlying stream.  That's tricky, though, because you then have to
 * start duplicating the work of keeping track of how much a reset rewinds.
 * Further, you have to watch out for the "readLimit", and since the semantics
 * for the readLimit leave room for differing implementations, you might get
 * into a lot of trouble.</p>
 *
 * <p>Alternatively, you could make this class extend
 * {@link java.io.BufferedInputStream}
 * and then use the protected members of that class to avoid duplicated effort.
 * That solution has the side effect of adding yet another possible layer of
 * buffering.</p>
 *
 * <p>Then, there is the simple choice, which this takes - simply don't
 * support {@link InputStream#mark} and {@link InputStream#reset}.  That choice
 * has the added benefit of keeping this class very simple.</p>
